BLACK BOX TESTING PLAN for REST API:

1. Unit testing

- GET request for all events

- GET request for specific event and check result exists in previous response

- POST event & then GET on posted event to check

- DELETE event & then GET deleted event, check response is empty

- PUT event & then GET event, check event is updated


2. Edge cases

- GET non-existent event, check system remains the same

- DELETE non-existent event, check system remains the same

- UPDATE non-existent event, check system remains the same


3. Flows

 - POST -> DELETE -> GET -> check response

 - PUT -> DELETE -> GET -> check response
